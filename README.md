# Phocus React test
Phocas Software: React / GraphQL test

My result of code challenge. I had to build my personal server side, since I've not got access to the API. I copied provided GraphQl schema, queries and mutation for testing. For using remote API you need to comment out line with baseUrl in axios/axios-api.js and uncomment API url.
