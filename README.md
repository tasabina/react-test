# Phocus React code challenge
Phocas Software: React / GraphQL test

The result of code challenge. I had to build server side, since I couldn't access to the provided API <strong>(java.lang.RuntimeException: Invalid access or {"message":"Missing Authentication Token"})</strong> errors. I copied provided GraphQl schema, queries and mutation for testing and implemented them by using NodeJS. In this project I used additional libraries as 'react-router-dom', 'redux', 'redux-thunk'
