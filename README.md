# React code challenge
React / GraphQL test

The result of code challenge. I've built server side, since I couldn't access to the provided API <strong>(java.lang.RuntimeException: Invalid access or {"message":"Missing Authentication Token"})</strong> errors. I've copied provided GraphQl schema, queries and mutation for testing and implemented them by using NodeJS.
